Question:

You are given a 2D integer array stockPrices where stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei] indicates the price of the stock on day dayi is pricei. A line chart is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:
Return the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart.

Example 1:
Input: stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.
The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
- Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).
- Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
- Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).
It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.


// Solution
class Solution {
    public int minimumLines(int[][] stockPrices) {
        int n = stockPrices.length;
        if(stockPrices.length == 1)
            return 0;
        Arrays.sort(stockPrices, Comparator.comparingInt(arr -> arr[0]));
        
        int count = 1;
        for(int i=2;i<n;i++) {
            
            if((stockPrices[i-1][1] - stockPrices[i-2][1])* (stockPrices[i][0] - stockPrices[i-1][0])!= (stockPrices[i][1] - stockPrices[i-1][1])*(stockPrices[i-1][0] - stockPrices[i-2][0])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
        
    }
}
